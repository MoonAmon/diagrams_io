Hello, everyone!

I'm writing my first article here. My name is Thiago, and I'm on a learning journey in the world of programming. Here, I aim to share my experiences and document the progress I make along the way.

Currently, I'm in my first semester of web development studies, where I'm learning the fundamentals of both front-end and back-end development. I'm exploring languages such as HTML, CSS, C++, and Python. I've also been participating in competitive programming games, which have helped me apply what I've learned and improve my skills.

I've developed a particular interest in backend development. The ability to create functional systems, handle logic and data processing, and build applications and services that provide a great user experience truly captivates me.

In this blog, my goal is to document my journey and share my progress, trends, and best practices that I discover along the way.

I believe that keeping a record of this journey will be an excellent way to track my progress, stay motivated to pursue new challenges and refine my skills. Additionally, I hope this blog can inspire other students and aspiring programmers to pursue their dreams and become more involved in the programming world.

I appreciate all of you for joining me and let's code!
